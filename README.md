Gemini

Motivation(s):
Having a burning passion to give back to the community, we have been looking for volunteering opportunities consistently. However, we realised that it is difficult to attain such opportunities as there is no common platform where volunteering opportunities can be uploaded or posted on, in addition to the fact that individual volunteering websites are not linked and updated frequently. We also found out that Telegram volunteering groups are non-responsive as well. To solve this issue, we decided to create a common platform whereby everyone can source for volunteering opportunities. 

Aim:
We hope to streamline the process of looking for volunteering opportunities as well as gather volunteers for organisations that host volunteering events. 

User stories
1. As a user seeking volunteering opportunities, I want to be able to see all the volunteering opportunities from all organisations and to be able to filter through them swiftly. 
2.As a youth seeking volunteering opportunities, I want to be able to locate and receive reminders for any volunteering activities near my location effectively. 
3.As a youth who has multiple commitments, I want to be able to receive prompts and reminders when the event is approaching. 
4.As an organiser, I want to be able to gather as many volunteers as fast as possible. 
5.As an organiser who is organising events, I want to be able to answer any queries from potential volunteers. 

Scope of Project
Key Features:
1) User Base - The application has a user base. Each User is required to sign up for an account which holds the user’s particulars and individualised profile.
2) Registration for event via the app - Allows Users to search up an event that they are interested to volunteer in and sign up via the app.
3) In-App Chat function - Allows communication between the User and the organiser of the event.
4) Navigation - After successfully signing up for the event, the navigation feature provides direction for the user to reach the event place.
5) Calendar - Keep track of when your registered events are. Links directly to your device’s calendar.
6) Feats - Contains the history of your volunteering. Can click in and see the event details of which you previously volunteered for.

Additional Features:
1) UI friendly - Efforts were put in to make the app user friendly with clean designs (Card view style & List style).
2) SplashScreen - To make it more morden.
3) Stickers and trophy system - Aim to include a point system. The more you volunteer, the more points you are awarded to obtain different stickers in the app.

Existing platforms:
1) Youth Corps Website - covers a diverse range of volunteer options for young people through ad - hoc basis, regular, and project-based service programs, with a focus on education, the environment, health, special needs, arts, sports, and history. Youth Corps Singapore Website is not fully optimised when users access the website through phone.

2) Volunteer.sg Application - A one-stop platform enabling citizens to organize and manage their volunteer activities. It also contains suggestions, keeps a record of volunteer commitments, syncs calendars, allows citizens to check in online, and links them with other like-minded volunteers. The launch of Volunteer.sg has received multiple bad reviews from the application store such as being buggy and not connecting well.

How is Voluntier Different:
We aim to be the go-to one-stop platform for people who want to volunteer. The process when using Voluntier is very stream-lined and efficient. The User interface is designed to be friendly and simplistic. Voluntier also has key features that the other app does not have.

Key Features that only Voluntier has:
In-app chat function to allow communication between organiser and user.
Inclusion of Google maps API which allows easy navigation for the User to the event space.
Reminders when event is nearing
